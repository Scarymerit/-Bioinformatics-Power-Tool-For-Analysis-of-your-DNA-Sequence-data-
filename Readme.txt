SO Welcome to this Complete Suite of Bioinformatics Power Tool For Analysis of your DNA Sequnce data 
develouped By me Sutripan Chaudhuri. The Code has used biopython Library to develoup this simple tool 
The Code can Take either sequnce in a fasta format or can fetch the data through Accession ID.

It can perform :

Analyze Features (GenBank only): If you used an Accession ID to get a GenBank file, 
this option will display a detailed table of all its annotated features, such as genes, coding sequences (CDS), 
and regulatory regions. It shows what each feature is, where it's located on the DNA, and other details.

Detailed Sequence Analysis: This gives you a statistical and biological summary of your sequence, including:
Basic Stats: Sequence ID, total length, GC content (%), and molecular weight.

ORF Finding: It automatically searches for potential Open Reading 
Frames (ORFs)—stretches of DNA that could code for proteins—and lists them for you, showing their length and on which strand they were found.

Translate DNA to Protein: This takes your DNA sequence and shows you the resulting amino acid (protein) sequence.

Sequence Alignment: This powerful feature allows you to compare sequences:

Pairwise Alignment: Compares two sequences. You can choose between:

Global Alignment: Tries to align the sequences from end to end.

Local Alignment: Finds the most similar regions within the two sequences.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA): If you upload a FASTA file with multiple sequences, 
this will align all of them together to identify conserved regions. (Note: This requires the ClustalW command-line tool to be installed on your computer).


How to use:
To keep the analysis simple and intuitive I have used Streamlit to make a website interface with all the options clearly visible and usable 
The very first step is to import the code in to any IDE Softwares like VS Code,Pycharm or even google collab. In either of the cases the underneath mentiond libraries must be 
installed first to use the application
"pip install streamlit biopython" paste this copmmand in your terminal wothout the quotations to to make use of the software
Now from the terminal itself paste this command "streamlit run bio_app.py"

the Application will appear on the browser.

Any changes to the code that might increse the quality of the suit is very much welcomed :)
